# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This application is a simple day schedule where a user is able to enter information at any hour during a weekday. The application uses basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript, along with localstorage to show data and save data to browser. A user has eight inputs where they can enter information for any hour from 9am to 5pm during the day. Each hour has a input text area and submit button to enter data. The data is stored in the localstorage of the browser, where the data is retrived everytime the user revists the page. The text can be updated and stored in localstorage when the submit button be added. Lastly, the application will check the time and show the current hour and the remain hours to highlight the day. 

## Usage
In order to use the application the user will need to go to the website or
install with git ssh key. If using ssh key the user will need to go to the
directory and then open the index.html file to view the web page. Once on the
application the user will view an 8 hour schedule with different colors.
Currently the red section is the current hour. The grey sections are the past
hours and the green sections are the future hours so the user is able to see
what time or what they should be doing. The user is able to enter text on each
hour and then press the enter button to add the data. The data is added to the
localstorage which allow the user to leave the page and come back later with the
same information. The information can be changed anytime as longj as the user
press the submit button.
